# Javascript Morse Code Translator

Hi, this is my vanilla JS morse code translator. It's made using vanilla Javascript, HTML & SCSS via a Object Oriented Test Driven approach. Using JEST, I made unit tests for the singleCharacterConverter and translator classes, which I made for conversion of morse code to text and vice versa.
